# scaling literally anything  

## roles held  
- head of shipping things that should never have been shipped  
- interim vp of “did you clear cache tho”  
- cto (chief tweak officer) @ random startup that pivoted 9 times in 2 weeks  
- ex-senior junior lead @ stealth mode nonsense  

## currently building / scaling / breaking  
- industrial inconvenience engineering  
- force push driven development  
- infinite regress abstractions (recursively)  
- liquification-as-a-service  
- analytical analysis™  
- rats (the gray startup founders of the street)  
- aura coding > vibe coding (vibes don’t raise a series a)  

## guiding principle  
> i don’t ship mvp. i ship mv💥p.
